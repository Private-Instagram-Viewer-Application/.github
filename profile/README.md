### What is a Private Instagram Viewer Application?

A **private Instagram viewer** is an application that claims to enable one in viewing private Instagram accounts without the permission of the owner. By default, when one sets his or her Instagram profile to private, only followers approved can have an ability to view posts, stories, and all other content. These are the **privacy settings for Instagram**, allowing each user to control who sees personal content.

However, several applications and websites boast of bypassing these settings and providing a way for one to **view private Instagram profiles** without following them. Most of the tools promise to reveal photos, videos, stories, and even personal information for users whose accounts are set to private.

#### How Do Private Instagram Viewer Tools Work?

A lot of the **Instagram profile viewer** tools available claim that using them is a pretty simple process. Typically, users have to enter the username of the private account that they are trying to access, and the application promises to fetch that content for them. Some applications request that users complete surveys, download additional software, or provide their personal information to gain access. Others will request a payment for full access to the private account.

But, similarly, one should be aware that **Privacy Settings on Instagram** aims at preventing unauthorized access to the private profiles. Advanced level of encryption and privacy controls are in place by the platform, ensuring that only the approved followers can view private content. In this regard, the chances are that none of these tools actually get around the security of Instagram.

### Is Using Private Instagram Viewer Apps Legal?

One of the biggest questions about **private Instagram viewer apps** is whether they are legal. More or less, the answer is no.

Such applications enable one to bypass the privacy settings in Instagram, hence against their set terms of service. The administration of Instagram is much concerned with privacy issues; as such, it works toward shutting down such apps and services that violate its policies. With a private Instagram viewer tool, the user is on the wrong side of the rules as imposed by Instagram; this might lead to penalties imposed by the company, including the suspension or banning of the account.

More than this, there are some legal issues about **applications of Instagram viewer** that may go further than the violation of Instagram politics. In some cases, the access to somebody's private information without their permission may be treated as a kind of violation of privacy law. In such a case, the developers of the application and users who have tried to view private profiles without permission may be brought to legal responsibilities.

### Risks and Consequences of Using Private Instagram Viewer Tools

Apart from the legal consequences, the usage of the applications related to **Instagram profile viewer** imposes a number of serious risks. The major ones are highlighted below:

#### Risks of Hacking of Your Instagram Account

Most of these private Instagram viewer apps were made with malicious intentions. Rather than offering the facility of viewing private Instagram profiles, these apps would most often try to steal the login credentials or any other personal information from the user. Once the hackers get into your account, they can do quite a number of things with your account, including spamming, posting inappropriate pictures or statuses, and even locking you out of your account completely.

Besides, it may take a lot of time and energy to recover in case it gets hacked. While Instagram takes account security seriously, getting back into one can take some time; especially if the hacker has changed your email and password.

#### Scams and Fake Instagram Profile Viewers

Another huge risk of using **Instagram viewer tools** is probably getting scammed. Most of the websites and applications claiming access to private Instagram accounts are scams. They will ask you to take endless surveys, download suspicious software, or provide them with your information by means of paying. Still, most likely, that tool is fake and won't provide access to those private accounts you wanted to see.

Instead, these scams try to get either personal information or some kind of payment from the users. Once you have given them this information, you may be at risk for identity theft or some other forms of cybercrime.

#### Instagram Privacy Violation and Ethical Concerns

Clearly and intentionally violating one's **Instagram privacy**, where a **private viewer on Instagram** accesses other people's private accounts without permission, is a serious breach. There is a reason why **Instagram privacy settings** exist-to allow people to make choices about their content viewed by others. Bypassing such settings is an ethical issue and may bring devastating consequences for the persons involved.

For instance, an attempt to see **somebody's private Instagram post without following** him/her can be regarded as a breach of his/her trust. Generally speaking, people create private accounts due to security concerns for personal information or susceptibility to predators, or simply because they do not want solicitation from unknown persons. Bypassing their settings goes against the wish of a person and has a potential of causing them more harm related to privacy matters such as harassment or **Instagram stalking problems**.

### Are There Ways to Legitimately View Private Instagram Profiles?

Although **private Instagram viewer applications** may seem so luring, the best method to check someone's private Instagram account is by following them. This way, sending a follow request and being in the queue until your response will result in respecting the individual's **Instagram settings for privacy** and legitimate access to his account.

It is just important to note that there really are some **Instagram account security concerns**. To that effect, Instagram provides a set of tools that may enable users to protect their profiles, including two-factor authentication and strong privacy controls. Always be aware of what disclosing personal information to certain apps or websites might lead to.

The only legitimate way to view someone's private Instagram account is to respect their privacy and wait for them to approve your follow request.

### How to Protect Your Instagram from Private Viewers

With the upswing of **private Instagram viewer tools**, one should pay more attention to the protection of an Instagram account from unauthorized access. Here are several recommendations on how to improve your **protection of data in Instagram** and avoid viewing of your content by unauthorized users:

#### 1. Two-Factor Authentication
Well, two-factor authentication just adds a layer of security to the account, in that you can only sign in with two forms of identification: your password and a verification code via phone. That way, others cannot access your account, even with your password.

#### 2. Set Your Account to Private
If you're sensitive about privacy, then your account, set to private, allows only the allowed followers to see what posts and stories you have up and personal information. This is one of the best ways to protect yourself from **unauthorized Instagram profile viewing**.

#### 3. Beware of Third-Party Apps
Many third-party applications claim to provide a number of additional features for the Instagram user, but most are security risks. Just do your research on the legitimacy of the app before allowing access, and check out the reviews of other users. If it requires permissions it does not need or seems fishy, avoid it.

#### 4. Regularly Review Your Followers
Even with a private account, you'll want to periodically purge your followers list to ensure that you are comfortable with who is viewing your content. If you don't think someone is trying to bypass this by creating a sham profile to follow you, then don't hesitate to remove them from your followers list.
